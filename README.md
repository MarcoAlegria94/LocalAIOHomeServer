# LocalAIOHomeServer
This will be a guide to look up to, when required to set up a home server with my specific needs.
Also used to follow the correct steps, that led me to a functioning server. After so many try&error, I have successfully set up the working server, so I dont forget how to set it up again if something is required.
It uses Ubuntu Server 24.04.3 as the OS.
